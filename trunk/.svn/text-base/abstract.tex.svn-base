\section*{ABSTRACT}

Computers permeate society deeper and more thoroughly as computer science and
adjacent fields progress.  Students who graduate from institutions of higher
education are expected to adapt to and utilize computer technologies, regardless
of major.  Many universities already offer computer science courses for
non-majors, but little research exists on methods to continuously update
existing curriculum.  We propose a method for updating computer science
curriculum for non-majors with IT key qualifications that teach students how to
adapt to an evolving technological ecosystem.  This framework addresses how to
update existing course objectives and materials using feedback from metrics,
such as the students' attitudes, performance on examinations, and the time to
prepare course materials. Our research finds that universities with existing
computer science curriculum for non-majors may be able to utilize the methods
outlined in this paper to teach students skills that foster confidence in
their relationships with computers in the present and future.
